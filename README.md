The [upstream](https://github.com/BuildAPKs) has scripts in order to build APKs collections from [Termux](https://github.com/termux/). The built  will be deposited into `Download/builtAPKs` directory. [`buildAll.bash`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuildAPKs/buildAPKs/master/scripts/bash/build/buildAll.bash) can build hundreds of APKs on your device, but **the purpose for this _fork_ is to turn the software as simple as possible.**
